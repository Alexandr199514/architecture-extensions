## 4.0 Goals
- [ ] Use Debuggycore datagen when that's a thing

- [ ] Use other Quilt APIs when appropriate (ex: Recipe API)
- [ ] Figure out the creative tab situation because currently, its a mess
- [ ] Redo block groupings
- [ ] Make rod blocks better lol


## About Architecture Extensions
The mod idea for Architecture Extensions is technically based off the old [ArchitectureCraft mod from MC 1.8-1.10](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architecturecraft). The major differences are that the added blocks are not "super detailed" like in the original AC mod and there are blocks that are not in the original mod either.

## About Ports
The debuggy team welcomes third party ports to previous minecraft versions, but respectfully asks that you don't port to Forge or Fabric.
