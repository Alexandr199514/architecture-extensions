## About Architecture Extensions
This mod is based on the original ArchitectureCraft mod from Minecraft 1.8 (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architecturecraft). The major differences are that the added blocks are not "super detailed" like in the original AC mod and there are blocks that are not in the original mod either.
